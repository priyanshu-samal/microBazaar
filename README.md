# üöÄ microBazaar: Your Next-Gen Microservices E-commerce Platform üöÄ

Welcome to **microBazaar**! This project is an ambitious journey into building a scalable, resilient, and feature-rich e-commerce platform using a microservices architecture. We're crafting a digital marketplace where every component works harmoniously yet independently, ensuring a robust and dynamic user experience.

## ‚ú® The MicroBazaar Vision: Why Microservices?

Imagine an e-commerce platform that can grow limitlessly, where new features can be added without disrupting existing ones, and where a hiccup in one area doesn't bring down the entire store. That's the power of microservices, and that's the vision for microBazaar!

We're breaking down the traditional monolithic application into smaller, manageable, and independently deployable services. This approach brings a plethora of benefits:

-   **Scalability:** Each service can be scaled independently based on its demand.
-   **Resilience:** A failure in one service won't cascade and affect the entire application.
-   **Agility:** Faster development cycles and easier deployment of new features.
-   **Technology Diversity:** Freedom to choose the best technology stack for each service.

## üó∫Ô∏è Architectural Blueprint: How It All Connects

microBazaar is designed as a constellation of specialized services, each handling a distinct domain of the e-commerce ecosystem. Think of it as a bustling marketplace where different shops (microservices) specialize in their craft, yet work together to serve the customer.

Initially, services communicate directly via RESTful APIs. However, our roadmap includes a powerful upgrade:

-   **RabbitMQ for Asynchronous Communication:** To ensure seamless, decoupled, and fault-tolerant communication, we'll be integrating **RabbitMQ**. This message broker will act as the central nervous system, allowing services to communicate asynchronously through events and messages. For example, when a user places an order, the `Order Service` can publish an event to RabbitMQ, and the `Inventory Service` (future) can subscribe to it to update stock, without direct dependencies.

-   **AWS Cloud Hosting:** Each microservice will find its home on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. We envision deploying these services independently across various AWS compute options (e.g., EC2, ECS, Lambda), leveraging AWS's robust infrastructure for high availability, scalability, and global reach. Each service will be a separate entity in the cloud, connecting securely to form the complete microBazaar platform.

### User Authentication Flow

```mermaid

    participant Client
    participant Auth_Service
    participant Auth_DB

    Client->>Auth_Service: POST /api/auth/register (email, password)
    Auth_Service->>Auth_DB: Check if user exists
    alt User does not exist
        Auth_Service->>Auth_DB: Save new user with hashed password
        Auth_Service-->>Client: 201 Created {user, token}
    else User exists
        Auth_Service-->>Client: 400 Bad Request (User already exists)
    end

    Client->>Auth_Service: POST /api/auth/login (email, password)
    Auth_Service->>Auth_DB: Find user by email
    alt User found
        Auth_Service->>Auth_Service: Compare password with hashed password
        alt Password matches
            Auth_Service->>Auth_Service: Generate JWT Token
            Auth_Service-->>Client: 200 OK {token}
        else Password does not match
            Auth_Service-->>Client: 401 Unauthorized (Invalid credentials)
        end
    else User not found
        Auth_Service-->>Client: 401 Unauthorized (Invalid credentials)
    end
```
